## Midterm Review
### The console
```

Before the creation of graphical user interfaces, all computing systems were simple console environments consisting as of a prompt for inputting a command and the display of the command output. All of the original programming tools ran as console application. The console tradition is still actively used by professional developers and most programming tools execute within a console window.

Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool. The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications.

There are many console applications that you can chose from. All operating systems come with a default console, but you will probably want to install one in order to get the best experience. Here is an example of Warp running on a Mac.

Warp

Make sure you have a console application
In order for you to successfully use the console for web programming it must be POSIX compliant. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. Both Mac and Linix support POSIX. That means any necessary console commands will work on those operating systems.

Getting a console application for Windows
If you are using Microsoft Windows you can get a reasonable approximation of a POSIX compliant console by installing Git Bash. When installing, use all the default settings.

Once it is installed, hit the Windows button on your keyboard, and type Git Bash. This should open a console window that looks something like the following. Make sure you look for the Git Bash icon so that you don't accidentally use an non-POSIX compatible console application.

Git Bash

⚠ Do not use Git Command, cmd, or Powershell. That will not work for the commands and scripts we run in this class.

You can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) (e.g Ubuntu on Windows) for your work in this class, but you must be very careful to do all of your work actually within WSL. Don't download files to your Windows partition and then access them from WSL. It is suggested that you use Git Bash instead of WSL, unless you are really familiar with WSL.

Testing your console application
Once you have a acceptable console application on your development computer, open it up and make sure you can run a simple POSIX compliant command such as printf 'hello\n'.

Console printf

If this displays hello then you are on the right track. If that doesn't work then you are using a console application that is not POSIX compliant. For example, Windows Powershell will not work.

Viewing the file system
One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the pwd (present working directory) command.

➜  pwd

/Users/student/byu//webprogramming260
You can list all of the files in the directory with ls (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, ls can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter -la.

➜ ls -la

Executing commands
The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform many different operations. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

echo - Output the parameters of the command
cd - Change directory
mkdir - Make directory
rmdir - Remove directory
rm - Remove file(s)
mv - Move file(s)
cp - Copy files
ls - List files
curl - Command line client URL browser
grep - Regular expression search
find - Find files
top - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
df - View disk statistics
cat - Output the contents of a file
less - Interactively output the contents of a file
wc - Count the words in a file
ps - View the currently running processes
kill - Kill a currently running process
sudo - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
ssh - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
scp - Securely copy files to a remote computer
history - Show the history of commands
ping - Check if a website is up
tracert - Trace the connections to a website
dig - Show the DNS information for a domain
man - Look up a command in the manual
You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

| - Take the output from the command on the left and pipe, or pass, it to the command on the right
> - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
>> - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists
For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into grep to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into wc to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

CTRL-R - Use type ahead to find previous commands
CTRL-C - Kill the currently running command
☑ Assignment
Experiment with console commands. Open a console window and create a test directory that you can play with by executing the command mkdir test (make directory). Then execute the command cd test to change into that directory. Then execute the following sequence of commands:

mkdir test
cd test
pwd
ls
ls -la
ls ../
printf "x" > test.txt
ls -l
cat test.txt
cp test.txt other.txt
ls
cat test.txt >> other.txt
rm test.txt
less other.txt # press `q` to exit less
for i in {1..2}; do printf 'y' >> other.txt; done;
Once you have done this, go over to the assignments page in Canvas and submit the text that results from running cat other.txt.

The better you get at working with the console the more efficient your programming will be.

### HTML

```

MDN HTML
W3C specification - This official specification is only for reference
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. HTML was originally designed to be a publishing format for web documents, or pages. From that original definition web programmers have morphed the web page concept into a web application where a page now represents either a single page application (SPA) or a large group of hyperlinked pages that form a multi-page application (MPA). By itself HTML is amazing, but to create a full web application we will need other technologies to style (CSS) our pages and make them interactive (JavaScript). For now, we will focus on creating the content structure with HTML.

Here is an example of a simple HTML document.

Hello world
The first thing you noticed is that this looks like a simple text document. That is because text is valid HTML. In order to provide structure to our text we need to introduce the concept of elements and their associated tag representation.

Elements and tags
HTML elements are represented with enclosing tags that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (p), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (<) and greater than (>) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (/) before its name.

<p>Hello world</p>
We can continue adding structure to the page with additional elements. Each of these elements may contain other elements that provide the structure of our web page. The html element represents the top level page structure. The head element contains metadata about the page and the page title. The body element represents the content structure. The main element represents the main content structure, as opposed to things like headers, footers, asides, and navigation content. These additional elements result in the following HTML page.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
However, when we render the HTML in a browser it would look exactly the same as our original simple text example. The reason for that is that HTML is almost completely about structure. The visual appearance of the web page won't really change until we start styling the page with CSS.

HTML Hello world

Attributes
Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the id attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The class attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (') or double quotes (") to delimit attribute values.

<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
Hyperlinks
One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
Complete example
HTML defines a header (<!DOCTYPE html>) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file. We can now add the header, some attributes, and more content to our document for a full example.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        HTML welcomes you to the amazing world of
        <span class="topic">web programming</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What will this mean to you?</p>
      <p class="assignment">Learn more <a href="instruction.html">here</a>.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
Intro HTML Example

Notice that the rendered document has almost no styling. That is because the entire purpose of HTML is to provide content and structure. The layout of the content is left almost entirely up to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). When styling was introduced with CSS, all of the HTML elements that defined style such as font, strike, and plaintext were deprecated.

Common elements
Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

element	meaning
html	The page container
head	Header information
title	Title of the page
meta	Metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
script	JavaScript reference. Either a external reference, or inline
include	External content reference
body	The entire content body of the page
header	Header of the main content
footer	Footer of the main content
nav	Navigational inputs
main	Main content of the page
section	A section of the main content
aside	Aside content from the main content
div	A block division of content
span	An inline span of content
h<1-9>	Text heading. From h1, the highest level, down to h9, the lowest level
p	A paragraph of text
b	Bring attention
table	Table
tr	Table row
th	Table header
td	Table data
ol,ul	Ordered or unordered list
li	List item
a	Anchor the text to a hyperlink
img	Graphical image reference
dialog	Interactive component such as a confirmation
form	A collection of user input
input	User input field
audio	Audio content
video	Video content
svg	Scalable vector graphic content
iframe	Inline frame of another HTML page
Comments
You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with <!-- and ending it with -->. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

<!-- commented text -->
Special characters
HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the entity syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (<) you would instead use the less than entity (&lt;). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

Character	Entity
&	&amp;
<	&lt;
>	&gt;
"	&quot;
'	&apos;
😀	&#128512;
HTML Versions
Understanding when different HTML features were introduced helps you know what has been around for a long time and probably supported by all browsers, and what is new and may not work everywhere. HTML is pretty stable, but it is still good to check a website like MDN or canIUse to make sure.

Year	Version	Features
1990	HTML1	format tags
1995	HTML2	tables, internationalization
1997	HTML3	MathML, CSS, frame tags
1999	HTML4	external CSS
2014	HTML5	email, password, media, and semantic tags
index.html
By default a web server will display the HTML file named index.html when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for https://google.com in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file https://google.com/index.html. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application index.html.

Rendering HTML
You can save any HTML file to your computer's disk and then open the file using your browser. You can also open the HTML file in VS Code and use the Live Server extension to display the HTML. Another way to easily play with HTML is to use a sandbox like CodePen. However, when you use CodePen it is not necessary to supply the HTML DocType header or the root html element since CodePen already assumes you are providing HTML. Here is our example HTML document rendered in CodePen.

HTML structure elements
The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top level content body. The body has three children, a header, main, and footer. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

The header contains a paragraph with a span, and a navigation containing multiple divisions of sub-content.

The main contains multiple sections that contain either an unordered list (ul) or a table. Main also contains an aside for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The footer has a content division with a single span.

<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
If we rendered this HTML, and added just a bit of styling, so we can see how they related to each other, we would see the following.

HTML structure

Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

Block and inline
There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element div (division) could have an inline element b in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a p (paragraph) element could have a span to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.</p>
☑ Assignment
Create a fork of this CodePen do the following:

Replace the navigation div elements with anchor elements that have hyperlinks to BYU and FamilySearch.
Change the section ul element text to be "apples", "bananas", and "oranges".
Add an img element to the aside element. Use the URL of an image on some other website. Use the width attribute to size it properly.
Add another row to the table with the text HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Add your name in a h1 element to the header element.
Add a hyperlink to the footer element to your GitHub repository.
When you are done save your changes and submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

HTML input elements
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Input element

From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

Element	Meaning	Example
form	Input container and submission	<form action="form.html" method="post">
fieldset	Labeled input grouping	<fieldset> ... </fieldset>
input	Multiple types of user input	<input type="" />
select	Selection dropdown	<select><option>1</option></select>
optgroup	Grouped selection dropdown	<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>
option	Selection option	<option selected>option2</option>
textarea	Multiline text input	<textarea></textarea>
label	Individual input label	<label for="range">Range: </label>
output	Output of input	<output for="range">0</output>
meter	Display value with a known range	<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>
Form element
The main purpose of the form element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the form container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the form element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a textarea element.

<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's name attribute with the current value of the textarea.

ta-id=Some+text
Input element
The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the type attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

Type	Meaning
text	Single line textual value
password	Obscured password
email	Email address
tel	Telephone number
url	URL address
number	Numerical value
checkbox	Inclusive selection
radio	Exclusive selection
range	Range limited number
date	Year, month, day
datetime-local	Date and time
month	Year, month
week	Week of year
color	Color
file	Local file
submit	button to trigger form submission
In order to create an input you specify the desired type attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

Attribute	Meaning
name	The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form
disabled	Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input
value	The initial value of the input
required	Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid
The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

HTML Input

Validating input
Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the required attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The pattern attribute exists on text, search, url, tel, email, and password inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.

☑ Assignment
This CodePen demonstrates all of the major input elements. Fork the pen and do the following:

Replace the text input's placeholder with "your name here".
Add an additional optgroup.
Add an additional checkbox.
Add an additional radio button.
Change the color input to default to red.
When you are done submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

HTML media elements
The HTML elements that represent media include img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. The img, audio, and video elements are all simple references to an external file, but svg and canvas both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

External media
The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named images that contains a file named photo.jpg you would use a relative path as follows.

images/photo.jpg
Image
To include an image in your content you use the img element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source image. In order to support accessibility, you should also include an alt attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
mountain landscape

Audio
To include an audio file in your content you use the audio element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the controls attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
Html Audio

Video
To include a video in your content you use the video element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the controls or autoplay attributes.

⚠ Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
HTML video

Internal media
The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
SVG demo

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this CodePen for an example.

Consult the MDN documentation if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

Canvas
The canvas element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

<canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>
If you would like to see some examples of complex canvas renderings check out these examples on CodePen.

Particles
Ribbons 2
☑ Assignment

Change the image to something else.
Change the video to something else.
Change the canvas element to display a blue circle.

Cascading Style Sheets
CSS Logo

📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive experience. The initial objective of CSS was to simply style the HTML based upon the desires of the user, developer, and browser. In modern web applications CSS styling focuses more on helping the developer create complex renderings of dynamic content that is responsive to the actions of the user and the device the application is rendered on. With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

Functionally, CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.

CSS definitions

For example, consider the following rule.

p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

CSS simple rule

Associating CSS with HTML
There are three ways that you can associate CSS with HTML. The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.

<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
styles.css

p {
  color: green;
}
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

Cascading styles
Because elements inherit the rules applied to their parents you often end up with the same declaration property applied to a single element multiple times. For example, we might set color property for all body elements to be red, and then paragraph elements to be green, and then span elements to be blue, and finally use a style element on a specific span to be black.

<body>
  <p><span style="color:black">CSS</span></p>
</body>
body {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
span {
  color: blue;
}
In this case, the rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration. You can see this happening if you use the browser's debugger. In Chrome right click on the element and select inspect. You can then click on each element in the debugger and see what the value of the color property is. For the case defined above you will see that each of the higher level declarations is crossed out until you get to the style explicitly defined on the element.

CSS cascade

The box model
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

CSS box model

By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the box-sizing CSS property from the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.

CSS Versions
As with HTML, CSS has evolved significantly over the years. The following version table gives you an idea of when certain features were added and therefore how stable the support for them are.

Year	Version	Features
1996	CSS1	selectors, font, color, background, alignment, margin, border, padding
1998	CSS2	positioning, z-index, bidirectional text, shadows
2011	CSS2.1	removed incompatible features
1999-2021	CSS3	enhancements for media, box, background, borders, color, template, multi-column, selectors
Beginning with CSS3 the specification was divided into modules so that they could be implemented at different levels of maturity. Whether these modules will culminate in a CSS4 specification has not yet been decided.

CSS Selectors
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN CSS selectors

The first step in understanding CSS is mastering how to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to. The CSS rule selector can take many forms. In order to explain the most common selectors we need some demonstration HTML. Let's image a simple document describing the departments in a university. In our case we have a physics and a chemistry department. The information provided is very sparse, but the structure provided by the HTML is enough to work with.

<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
By default every browser defines a base set of styles that it applies to all HTML. This varies slightly from browser to browser, but for the most part our document would render like this using the base browser styles.

CSS selectors base

We would like to style our document so that it looks like this when we are done.

CSS selectors final

Element type selector
To start things off, we want to make all elements in the document use a sans-serif font. We can do this by using an element name selector. By selecting the body element we will cascade our declaration down to all the children of the body, which is the whole document.

body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
Note that we could also use the wildcard element name selector (*) to select all elements, but for our needs the body element will work just fine.

We can also use element name selectors to give a bottom border to the top level heading (h1), as well as modify the section elements to pop out with a gray background and some white space in the padding and margins.

h1 {
  border-bottom: thin black solid;
}

section {
  background: #eeeeee;
  padding: 0.25em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
Combinators
Next we want to change the color of the second level headings (h2), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a descendant combinator that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all h2 elements that are descendants of section elements.

section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

Combinator	Meaning	Example	Description
Descendant	A list of descendants	body section	Any section that is a descendant of a body
Child	A list of direct children	section > p	Any p that is a direct child of a section
General sibling	A list of siblings	div ~ p	Any p that has a div sibling
Adjacent sibling	A list of adjacent sibling	div + p	Any p that has an adjacent div sibling
We can use the general sibling combinator to increase the whitespace padding on the left of paragraphs that are siblings of a level two heading.

h2 ~ p {
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}
Class selector
The next selector we will use is the class selector. Remember that any element can have zero or more classifications applied to it. For example, our document has a class of introduction applied to the first paragraph, and a class of summary applied to the final paragraph of each section. If we want to bold the summary paragraphs we would supply the class name summary prefixed with a period (.summary).

.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
ID selector
ID selectors reference the ID of an element. All IDs should be unique within an HTML document and so this select targets a specific element. To use the ID selector you prefix the ID with the hash symbol (#). We would like to showcase our physics department by putting a thin purple border along the left side of the physics section.

#physics {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
Attribute selector
Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (a[href]). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (a[href="./fish.png"]) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (p[href*="https://"]).

p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
For a full description of attribute selections refer to MDN.

Pseudo selector
CSS also defines a significant list of pseudo selectors which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes. We will give just one example. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.

section:hover {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
You can find out more about pseudo selectors on MDN.

CSS Declarations
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN reference section on properties

CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

Property	Value	Example	Discussion
background-color	color	red	Fill the background color
border	color width style	#fad solid medium	Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided

top	unit	50px	The vertical value of a positioned element
transform	transform-function	rotate(0.5turn)	Applies a transformation to the element
width	unit	25vmin	Sets the width of the box
z-index	number	100	Controls the positioning of the element on the z axis
Units
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Values and units

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (px) or inches (in). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (50%), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (25vmin), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (1.5rem) as defined by the root element.

p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

Unit	Description
px	The number of pixels
pt	The number of points (1/72 of an inch)
in	The number of inches
cm	The number of centimeters
%	A percentage of the parent element
em	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the parent's font
rem	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the root's font
ex	A multiplier of the height of the element's font
vw	A percentage of the viewport's width
vh	A percentage of the viewport's height
vmin	A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension
vmax	A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension
Color
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Applying color

CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

Method	Example	Description
keyword	red	A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)
RGB hex	#00FFAA22 or #0FA2	Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity
RGB function	rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)	Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage
HSL	hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)	Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is.
Experiment
⚠ This CodePen demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.

CSS Fonts
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Web fonts

Choosing appropriate fonts is a key web application design characteristic. A beautiful modern font will make your application enjoyable to use. Picking a hard to read font, an overused font, or using too many fonts will turn users away.

The CSS font-family property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

Font families
There are four major families of fonts: Serif, sans-serif, fixed, and symbol. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes; sans-serif fonts do not. Fixed fonts characters all are the same size. This is useful for lining up text when doing things like coding or displaying tabular data. Symbol fonts represent non-language characters such as arrows or emojis.

Importing fonts
In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you provide with your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the @font-face rule and provide the font name and source location.

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
If you do not want to host font files on your server, then you can load them from a font provider. For example, Google provides a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
This CodePen provides an example of importing fonts.

CSS Animation
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Animation

Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like at different times in the animation. Let's walk through an example.

We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.

p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;
}
To make this happen we specify that we are animating the selected elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence. We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.

p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;

  animation-name: demo;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We don't have to define what happens at every millisecond of the animation. Instead we only need to define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another. In our case we simply want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.

@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
That's everything we need to do. However, let's make one more addition. It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.

@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  95% {
    font-size: 21vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
CSS animation

You can see this animation working with this CodePen.

Animation is not just for pushing buttons or making text float around. Here is an example of animating a watch using only HTML and CSS.

Responsive design
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Responsive design

Modern web applications are expected to run well on a large variety of computing devices. This includes everything from desktops, to mobile phones, to shopping kiosks, to car dashboards. This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called responsive design.

Much of HTML and CSS is already fluid due to the fact that it responds to the browser window being resized. For example a paragraph element will resize when the browser window is resized. However, the following features can completely change the layout of the application based on the device's size and orientation.

Display
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Display

The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. The common options for the display property include the following.

Value	Meaning
none	Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.
block	Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A p or div element has block display by default.
inline	Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A b or span element has inline display by default.
flex	Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.
grid	Display this element's children in a grid orientation.
We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of div elements. By default div elements have a display property value of block.

<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>
With the default of block this HTML would render like this.

CSS default div display

If we modify the display property associated with each element with the following CSS, then we get a totally different rendering.

.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
CSS display

You can experiment with different display property values with this CodePen.

Viewport meta tag
When smart mobile devices started gaining popularity they began to be used to view websites. However, the websites were optimized for desktop displays and not little tiny mobile screens. To solve this mobile browsers automatically started scaling the website so that it looked better on a small screen. Unfortunately, as web applications started being responsive to the screen size, the mobile browser's scaling got in the way. The solution is to include a meta tag in the head element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
Float
The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}
CSS float

When the browser resizes, the text will flow around the floating element. You can use this CodePen to experiment with float. Try changing the descriptor value to none or left and see what happens.

Media queries
One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the @media selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.

We can use the @media selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.

@media (orientation: portrait) {
  div {
    transform: rotate(270deg);
  }
}
We can demonstrate the result of applying the media selector by using the browser's debugger and switching into phone and responsive mode. You can also use this CodePen and play with it yourself by simply resizing the browser's window.

CSS Media orientation

You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.

@media (orientation: portrait) {
  aside {
    display: none;
  }
}
CSS Media orientation

Here is the CodePen for this example.

Grid and Flexbox
The final two responsive technologies that we want to discuss are Grid and Flexbox. These are both CSS display modes that automatically respond to screen sizes to position and resize their child elements. We will discuss each of these in detail in the following instruction.

CSS Grid
📖 Deeper dive reading:

MDN Grid
Grid by example
The grid display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.

<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS display property with the value of grid on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The grid-template-columns property specifies the layout of the grid columns. We set this to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (1fr) of the parents total width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts. Next, we fix the height of the rows to be exactly 300 pixels by specifying the gird-auto-rows property. Finally, we finish off the grid configuration by setting the grid-gap property to have a gap of at least 1 em between each grid item.

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
Here is what the finished product looks like.

CSS Flexbox
📖 Deeper dive reading:

MDN Flexbox
CSS Tricks Flexbox
Flexbox Froggy
The flex display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes. In order to demonstrate the power of flex we will build an application that has a header, footer, and a main content area that is split into two sections, with controls on the left and content on the right.

So we can visualize our design by quickly sketching it out.

CSS App mock

Next we build our structural HTML to match our design.

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>CSS flex &amp; media query</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Content</h2>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <h2>Footer</h2>
  </footer>
</body>
Now we can use Flexbox to make it all come alive. We make the body element into a responsive flexbox by including the CSS display property with the value of flex. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a flex flow. We want our top level flexbox children to be column oriented and so we add the flex-direction property with a value of column. We then add some simple other declarations to zero out the margin and fill the entire viewport with our application frame.

body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
To get the division of space for the flexbox children correct we add the following flex properties to each of the children.

header - flex: 0 80px - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
footer - flex: 0 30px - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
main - flex: 1 - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be flex and specify the flex-direction to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.
header {
  flex: 0 80px;
  background: hsl(223, 57%, 38%);
}

footer {
  flex: 0 30px;
  background: hsl(180, 10%, 10%);
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
Now we just need to add CSS to the control and content areas represented by the two child section elements. We want the controls to have 25% of the space and the content to have the remaining. So we set the flex property value to 1 and 3 respectively. That means that the controls get one unit of space and the content gets three units of space. No matter how we resize things this ratio will responsively remain.

section:nth-child(1) {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
}
section:nth-child(2) {
  flex: 3;
  background-color: white;
}
Media Query
That completes our original design, but we also want to handle small screen sizes. To do this, we add some media queries that drop the header and footer if the viewport gets too short, and orient the main sections as rows if it gets too narrow.

To support the narrow screen (portrait mode), we include a media query that detects when we are in portrait orientation and sets the flex-direction of the main element to be column instead of row. This causes the children to be stacked on top of each other instead of side by side.

To handle making our header and footer disappear when the screen is to short to display them, we use a media query that triggers when our viewport height has a maximum value of 700 pixels. When that is true we change the display property for both the header and the footer to none so that they will be hidden. When that happens the main element becomes the only child and since it has a flex value of 1, it takes over everything.

@media (orientation: portrait) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
  header {
    display: none;
  }
  footer {
    display: none;
  }
}
Here is what the finished application looks like.

Debugging CSS
📖 Deeper dive reading: MDN Debugging CSS

CSS is extremely powerful, but sometimes is can be very frustrating to figure out why your page is not rendering the way that you expect. To help you understand why things are rendering the way they are you can use the browser's developer tool to inspect the CSS properties and visualize the HTML layout. Using the Google Chrome debugger you can access the developer tools by right clicking on the HTML page element that you want to debug and selecting the inspect option. You can experience this by creating a directory that contains the following content, composed of an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (index.css). This simple example has one paragraph of text and uses flex to center the text.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Center text in centered element</p>
  </body>
</html>
* {
  border: thick solid blue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 0.2em;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-family: Arial;
}

html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

p {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}
Open the directory with VS Code and use the Live Server extension to view the HTML in the Chrome browser. In the browser, right click on the text and select inspect. This will open the debugger window and display the Elements tab. As you move your cursor over the different elements you will visually see what the padding, borders, and margins are set to. The Styles pane shows all of the CSS properties applied to the currently selected element. If you scroll down to the bottom of the styles pane you will see the CSS box. By moving the cursor over the different parts of the CSS box it will highlight the different box parts in the browser window.

Debugging CSS

You can change any of the CSS properties, and even add new properties, directly in the debugger. This allows you to see what each property is contributing and change them to see how that impacts the rendering. This is a great way to figure out what CSS works best without having to continually change the CSS file and refresh the browser.

This example has a small problem. Each element has with a blue border and some padding. But the body element does not render any padding at the bottom. Inspecting the body element and looking at the CSS box reveals that the default margin for the elements is pushing the body element down so that the padding overflows into its parent element. We can fix this by setting the margin for elements to be zero.

Debugging CSS demo

Now, notice that if you resize the browser so that it is wider, the centered text will appear left justified.

Debugging CSS centered text

See if you can figure out what the problem is, and then correct the CSS so that the text always appears centered in the box.

Experiment with debugging and altering the CSS. Note that you can open up any website and use the debugger to see how they implemented their design and even do temporary alterations to the CSS properties to see how that impacts the display. Debugging other people's code is a great way to learn how to improve your CSS skills.

CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks provide functions and components that commonly appear in web applications. As web developers built more and more web applications they began to use the same patterns over and over. They combined these patterns into a shared package of code and contributed it to the world as open source repositories. This helped not only decrease the time to develop an application, but created a common user experience for the web in general.

Today, there are lots of different open source CSS frameworks available to choose from. Many of them contain the same types of functionality, but they all bring something a little different to the table.

Tailwind
A new rising contender in the CSS framework space is Tailwind CSS and its associated component library Tailwind UI. In the 2022 StateOfCSS poll, Tailwind gained an impressive 46% general usage ranking with a retention rating of 78%, all within the last four years.

Tailwind takes a different approach than traditional CSS frameworks. Instead of using large, rich, CSS rulesets to compartmentalize styling and functionality, it uses smaller definitions that are applied specifically to individual HTML elements. This moves much of the CSS representation out of the CSS file and directly into the HTML.

<div class="pt-6 md:p-8 text-center md:text-left space-y-4">
  <img class="w-24 h-24 md:w-48 md:h-auto md:rounded-none rounded-full mx-auto" src="profile.png" />
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">“Tailwind CSS”</p>
</div>
Bootstrap
🔑 Required reading: Getting started with Bootstrap

The reigning champion for CSS frameworks is Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been supported by an active and vibrant community for over a decade and contains many lessons learned from real world applications. The major downside of Bootstrap is its own success. Because it is so popular, Bootstrap defines the de facto look and feel of websites. This is great for user experience continuity, but it makes it difficult for a website to grab the attention of new users.

Getting bootstrap
You can integrate Bootstrap into your web applications simply by referencing the Bootstrap CSS files from their content delivery network (CDN). You then add the HTML link elements to your head element like this.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
If you are going to use Bootstrap components that require JavaScript (carousel, buttons, and more), you will also need to include Bootstrap's JavaScript module. You add this by putting the following at the end of your HTML body element.

<body>
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
You don't need to worry about this now, but later on, when we introduce the downloading of JavaScript packages, you can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to download Bootstrap and include it in your source code. That way you don't have to rely on someone else's server to provide you with a vital piece of your application. For future reference, to include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console.

npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
⚠ Note that those links are version specific (version 5 in this case). You will want to get the latest version links when you begin building your application.

Using bootstrap
Once you have Bootstrap linked in your HTML files you can begin using the components it provides. Let's start with a simple button. When we use the Bootstrap btn CSS class, the button gets a nice looking rounded appearance. The Bootstrap btn-primary CSS class shades the button with the current primary color for the application, which by default is blue. The following demonstrates the difference between a Bootstrap style button and a plain vanilla button. Functionally they both work exactly the same. The Bootstrap button is just a lot easier on the eyes.

// Bootstrap styled button
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap</button>

// Default browser styled button
<button type="button">Plain</button>

This deliverable adds a single CSS file (main.css) that contains the CSS for the entire application. Each of the HTML files references the CSS file using the link element.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
```
